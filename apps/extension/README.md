# Recall — Continuity Companion (browser extension)

The browser side of Recall. It does two things, kept deliberately
separate:

1. **Capture** (`background.js`) — quietly records page visits,
   search queries, and chat-platform sessions and POSTs them to the
   local Recall daemon at `127.0.0.1:4545`.
2. **The popup** (`popup/`, built from `ui/`) — a small memory
   *surface*. Open it and it answers one question: *what was I
   doing?* It is not a telemetry dashboard, not browser analytics,
   not an assistant.

Nothing leaves the machine. No remote network. No DOM scraping. No
telemetry. The only HTTP destination this extension can reach is the
loopback Recall daemon.

```

Chrome loads `apps/extension/` as the unpacked extension.
`manifest.json` and `background.js` are hand-written at that root;
`popup/` is a build artifact produced from `ui/`.

## Build the popup

```bash
cd apps/extension/ui
npm install
npm run build      # type-checks, then writes apps/extension/popup/
```

`npm run dev` serves the popup in a normal browser tab for fast
iteration (the daemon calls fall back gracefully when `chrome.*`
APIs are absent).

## The popup

A 440 px-wide companion. One fresh read of the daemon per open —
never a stale cached dashboard. Sections, top to bottom:

| Section | Answers |
|---|---|
| **Continue** | the single strongest interrupted investigation, with a **Resume** button |
| **Active investigations** | up to four ongoing topics |
| **Browser memory** | recent searches / tabs / chats, grouped |
| **Trust** | local-only, daemon status, events captured today |
| **Settings** | capture toggles + links (reached via the header gear) |

### Popup states

The popup is a small state machine. Every non-normal state is a
calm, full-body screen — no red, no error iconography. For
storybook-style isolated preview, append a `state` query param when
running `npm run dev`:

| `?state=` | Screen |
|---|---|
| `loading` | first daemon read in flight |
| `connected` | the normal surface |
| `disconnected` | daemon not running — capture continues, Resume offline |
| `reconnecting` | a retry in flight |
| `offline` | the browser itself has no network (Recall never needed it) |

The empty state (connected, but nothing captured yet) appears on
its own when there is genuinely nothing to show.

### Design language

Calm, quiet, spatial, trustworthy, minimal — Raycast × Arc ×
Granola. Light surfaces over warm off-white, soft hairline borders,
14 px radius, a 24 px section rhythm. One accent (lavender), used
once per zone. No glass, no neon, no charts, no gradient "AI"
energy. Motion is continuity motion only — fade, expand, slide —
on a single calm easing curve, never a bounce or a float.

See [`architecture.md`](architecture.md) for the component model
and data flow.

## What it captures

| Page | Becomes |
|---|---|
| Any normal page (`https://…`) | `browser_visit` |
| Google / DuckDuckGo / Bing / Kagi search | `browser_search` |
| chatgpt.com / chat.openai.com / claude.ai | `chat_session` |

## What it never captures

- `chrome://`, `edge://`, `about:`, `file://`, `view-source:` — dropped
  before they leave the worker.
- Incognito / Private windows.
- Page contents — only the URL and title. The DOM is never read.
- Anything in your domain exclude list (Recall → Settings → Browser
  Memory).

## Privacy contract

- `host_permissions` is exactly one URL — `http://127.0.0.1:4545/*`.
  Chrome refuses any other network request from this extension.
- No `<all_urls>` permission; only the `tabs` API (URL + title
  metadata, never page contents).
- All captured data lives in plain JSONL under `~/.recall/events/`.

## Install (developer mode)

1. Build the popup (above).
2. Make sure the Recall desktop app is running.
3. Open `chrome://extensions` (or `edge://extensions`).
4. Toggle **Developer mode**.
5. **Load unpacked** → pick this `apps/extension/` folder.

## Icons

Icons are intentionally not bundled — Chrome falls back to a default
glyph. Add `icons/icon-{16,48,128}.png` plus an `"icons"` block in
`manifest.json` for a custom toolbar icon.
